# Me... #
-------------------------------------------------------

Currently serving my sentence as a PhD student, but other than that:

- I love music and and play several instruments
- When I'm not working (rarely ever happens) you'd probably find me at the beach
- Fully trilingual, which unfortuantely only makes me even more addicted to TV shows in all three languages
- The two women in my life (my mom and my wife) both think I'm tolerable, so I must be doing something right...
